I also found this while looking for the other one  I sent you.  You might use this one for your own experimenting:

It is a complete containerized PHP stack.
Something that may not be obvious with all these examples:  You only need one NGINX container and one database.

The procedure here is reasonably up to date and very complete.  Of note is using gunicorn in the python container to actually runs the app.  
This still doesn’t take care of static files as well as I would like (I would like them linked into the NGINX container) 
but it works fairly well.  Note that the Redis container is not required but you will have to do some edits to the Django app to remove it.
Let me know how you make out…
